- AIM 4: Provide data on the rise or decline in deaths in America


## Impact and Intended Results
The AIDs/HIV virus has been a major topic in America for many years. Scientist and Doctors have developed ways to manage this by creating medicines and prevention tools over the last 10 years.  
Our intent on this project is to analysis data on the rise or decline on HIV/AIDs in America by covering these questions:
- What age group is mostly affect? 
- What are the counts by 2011-2017?
- Whawt are the reasons people contract HIV/AIDS? 
- What race/ethicity is most affected the most by HIV/AIDS?
- What gender(Men or Women) are mostly affected? 
- How many deaths per year came from HIV/AIDs in America? 
- What state experiences the highest death rate per year? 


## The Plan
1. Group by Age to show the Mean Count of the group mostly affected by HIV/AIDs 
2. Look at the Sum of the year that had the highest impact in HIV/AID cases
3. Provide the main reasons that HIV/AIDs was contracted during 2011-2017
